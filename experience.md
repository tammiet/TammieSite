Full-Stack Software Engineering Experience
---------

**Menlo Innovations**, software consultancy
Technical Projects
:	*Mallard – DoItBest*
* Coordinated with a team of High-Tech Anthropologists and developers to engineer a site for processing payments and implementing business logic.
* Worked in an ASP.NET framework using JavaScript, C#, and MySQL.

**NewFoundry**, software solutions consultancy
Technical Projects
:	*GTM & E1x Training Module – Renesas*
* Developed learning web apps in ReactJS. The apps allows users to learn about Bosch’s E1x and GTM microcontrollers through narrated slides, featuring animated SVGs to highlight portions of the microcontroller. 
* Created a custom IDE which allows users to drag and drop blocks of ‘code’ onto the IDE. Users are able to step through the code using a debugger. The rendered code is used to run the simulated microcontroller’s clock cycle.
* Used HTML canvas to make a ‘machine’ which simulates scheduling algorithms (eg. round robin, single prioritization). Users were able to use a customized switch widget to turn ‘on’ and ‘off’ channels.
Was in charge of QA on multiple interfaces (tablets, Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Internet Explorer 11) and communicating with the client throughout the QA process
